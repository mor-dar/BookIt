ToDo:
1. Downsample according to image capture size? (works well when long side is ~1000 px)
2. After a everything is done, if the user comes back to BookIt, the program does not close the result view when it should
   (The camera is active, but the result view is sitting on top of the camera preview, so the user can't see what he's trying to photograph).
3.  Move saved image into BookIt Folder.
   
4. Need to implement multiple book check somehow.
  The idea - run the sifts find the book with the largest number of matches, then throw out 
   the sifts used, and run it again.  Do this until all books are under some threshold of matches ( ~50 good matches?). Note, we may need to 
   change the return value to an array of links (strings) instead of just a single one.  

   Should we use homography for this (sometimes doesn't work - has issues if there is a false good match) or display the book covers 
   in a gridview for user selection?  Does amazons api allow for this to happen easily?
4. Need to read the database into memory on load instead of onpicture taken??

5. Clean up & comment code..

Anything else?

This is here to serve as an ongoing to do list.

1. Clean up java code.  
2. After a everything is done, if the user comes back to BookIt, the program does not close the result view when it should
   (The camera is active, but the result view is sitting on top of the camera preview, so the user can't see what he's trying to photograph).
3. Need to implement multiple book check somehow.  The idea - run the sifts find the book with the largest number of matches, then throw out 
   the sifts used, and run it again.  Do this until all books are under some threshold of matches ( ~50 good matches?). Note, we may need to 
   change the return value to an array of links (strings) instead of just a single one.  
4. Need to read the database into memory on load instead of onpicture taken.  
5. Different type of database (something better than an xml)?  couchDB? 

Anything else?
